# Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core
## Overview
ASP.NET Core introduced the concept of "Minimal APIs" to allow developers to build lightweight, succinct, and performant HTTP APIs with minimal boilerplate. Minimal APIs reduce the amount of ceremony required to set up a web API, making it faster and more straightforward to get up and running.
## Learning objectives
-   The motivation behind Minimal APIs
-   How to create a Minimal API from scratch
-   Working with request and response
-   Basic routing and handling HTTP methods
## Prerequisites
-   Basic understanding of C#
-   Familiarity with HTTP and RESTful services
-   Experience with ASP.NET Core would be beneficial but not required
